/*! \page addquestion Adding the question
  Qt provides a few low-level global functions for fine-tuning
    applications. Most of these perform very specific tasks and are
    platform-specific. In general, we recommend that you try using
    Qt's public API before resorting to using any functions mentioned
    here.
